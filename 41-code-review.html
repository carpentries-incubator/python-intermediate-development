<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>So far in this course we’ve focused on learning software design and
(some) technical practices, tools and infrastructure that help the
development of software in a team environment, but in an individual
setting. Despite developing tests to check our code - no one else from
the team had a look at our code before we merged it into the main
development stream. Software is often designed and built as part of a
team, so in this episode we will be looking at how to manage the process
of team software development and improve our code by engaging in code
review process with other team members.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="collaborative-code-development-models">Collaborative Code Development Models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#collaborative-code-development-models"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>The way a team provides contributions to a shared codebase depends on
the type of development model used in a project. Two commonly used
models are described below.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fork-and-pull-model">Fork and Pull Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fork-and-pull-model"></a></h3>
<p>In the <strong>fork and pull</strong> model, anyone can
<strong>fork</strong> an existing repository (to create their copy of
the project linked to the source) and push changes to their personal
fork. A contributor can work independently on their own fork as they do
not need permissions on the source repository to push modifications to a
fork they own. The changes from contributors can then be
<strong>pulled</strong> into the source repository by the project
maintainer on request and after a code review process. This model is
popular with open source projects as it reduces the start up costs for
new contributors and allows them to work independently without upfront
coordination with source project maintainers. So, for example, you may
use this model when you are an external collaborator on a project rather
than a core team member.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="shared-repository-model">Shared Repository Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#shared-repository-model"></a></h3>
<p>In the <strong>shared repository model</strong>, collaborators are
granted push access to a single shared code repository. By default,
collaborators have write access to the main branch. However, it is best
practice to create feature branches for new developments and protect the
main branch from direct and unreviewed commits to keep it stable - see
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule" class="external-link">GitHub’s
documentation</a> on how to do this. While this model of collaboration
requires more upfront coordination, it makes it easier to share each
other’s work. It works well for more stable teams and is more prevalent
with teams and organisations collaborating on private projects.</p>
</div>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="code-review">Code Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-review"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Regardless of the collaborative code development model your team
uses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review" class="external-link">code
review</a> is one of the widely accepted best practices for software
development in teams and something you should adopt in your development
process too.</p>
<p>Code review is a software quality assurance practice where one or
several people from the team (different from the code’s author) check
the software by viewing parts of its source code at the point when the
code changes. Code review is very useful for all parties involved -
someone checks your design or code for errors and gets to learn from
your solution; having to explain code to someone else clarifies your
rationale and design decisions in your mind too.</p>
<p>Code review is universally applicable throughout the software
development cycle - from design to development to maintenance. According
to Michael Fagan, the author of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagan_inspection" class="external-link">code inspection
technique</a>, rigorous inspections can remove 60-90% of errors from the
code even before the first tests are run (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1147%2Fsj.153.0182" class="external-link">Fagan, 1976</a>).
Furthermore, according to Fagan, the cost to remedy a defect in the
early (design) stage is 10 to 100 times less compared to fixing the same
defect in the development and maintenance stages, respectively. Since
the cost of bug fixes grows in orders of magnitude throughout the
software lifecycle, it is far more efficient to find and fix defects as
close as possible to the point where they were introduced.</p>
<p>There are several <strong>code review techniques</strong> with
various degree of formality and the use of a technical infrastructure,
including:</p>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review/#Over-the-shoulder%20reviews" class="external-link">Over-the-shoulder
code review</a> - one developer talks the other developer through the
code changes while sitting at the same machine.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review/#Pair%20programming" class="external-link">Pair
programming</a> - two developers work on the code at the same time with
one of them actively coding and the other providing real-time
feedback.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagan_inspection" class="external-link">Formal code
inspection</a> - up to 6 partipants go through a formalised process to
inspect the code specification or design for defects.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review/#Tool-assisted%20reviews" class="external-link">Tool
assisted code review</a> - developers use tools such as GitHub to review
the code independently and give feedback.</li>
</ul><p>You can read more about these techniques in the <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/lieber/courses/cs4500/f07/lectures/code-review-types.pdf" class="external-link">“Five
Types of Review” section</a> of the <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/19324443/best-kept-secrets-of-peer-code-review-pdf-smartbear" class="external-link">“Best
Kept Secrets of Peer Code Review” eBook</a>.</p>
<p>It is worth trying multiple code review techniques to see what works
best for you and your team. We will have a look at the
<strong>tool-assisted code review process</strong>, which is likely to
be the most effective and efficient. We will use GitHub’s built-in code
review tool - <strong>pull requests</strong>, or PRs. It is a
lightweight tool, included with GitHub’s core service for free and has
gained popularity within the software development community in recent
years.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="code-reviews-via-githubs-pull-requests">Code Reviews via GitHub’s Pull Requests<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-reviews-via-githubs-pull-requests"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Pull requests are fundamental to how teams review and improve code on
GitHub (and similar code sharing platforms) - they let you tell others
about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub and
that your code is ready for review. Once a pull request is opened, you
can discuss and review the potential changes with others on the team and
add follow-up commits based on the feedback before your changes are
merged into the development branch. The name ‘pull request’ suggests you
are <strong>requesting</strong> the codebase moderators to
<strong>pull</strong> your changes into the codebase.</p>
<p>Such changes are normally done on a feature branch, to ensure that
they are separate and self-contained, that the main branch only contains
“production-ready” work, and that the development branch contains code
that has already been extensively tested. You create a branch for your
work based on one of the existing branches (typically the development
branch but can be any other branch), do some commits on that branch,
and, once you are ready to merge your changes, create a pull request to
bring the changes back to the branch that you started from. In this
context, the branch from which you branched off to do your work and
where the changes should be applied back to is called the <strong>base
branch</strong>, while the feature branch that contains changes you
would like to be applied is the <strong>compare branch</strong>.</p>
<p>How you create your feature branches and open pull requests in GitHub
will depend on your collaborative code development model:</p>
<ul><li>In the fork and pull model, where you do not have write permissions
to the source repository, you need to fork the repository first before
you create a feature branch (in your fork) to base your pull request
on.</li>
<li>In the shared repository model, in order to create a feature branch
and open a pull request based on it you must have write access to the
source repository or, for organisation-owned repositories, you must be a
member of the organisation that owns the repository. Once you have
access to the repository, you proceed to create a feature branch on that
repository directly.</li>
</ul><p>In both development models, it is recommended to create a feature
branch for your work and the subsequent pull request, even though you
can submit pull requests from any branch or commit. This is because,
with a feature branch, you can push follow-up commits as a response to
feedback and update your proposed changes within a self-contained
bundle. The only difference in creating a pull request between the two
models is how you create the feature branch. In either model, once you
are ready to merge your changes in - you will need to specify the base
branch and the compare branch.</p>
<p>Let us see this in action - you are going to act as a reviewer on a
proposed change to the codebase contributed by a fictional colleague on
one of your fellow learner’s repository. One of your fellow learners
will review the proposed changes on your repository. Once the review is
done, you will then take on the role of the fictional colleague and
respond to the review on your repository. If you are completing the
course by yourself, you can add the review on the proposed changes in
your own repository and then respond to your own review comments by
fixing the proposed code. This is actually a very sensible thing to do
in general - looking at your own code in a review window will allow you
to spot mistakes you have not seen before.</p>
<p>Here is an outline of the process of a tool assisted code review.</p>

<p>Once a review has been raised it is over to the reviewer to review
the code and submit feedback.</p>
<p>Reviewing code effectively takes practice. However, here is some
guidance on what you should be looking for when reviewing a piece of
code.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="things-to-look-for-in-a-code-review">Things to Look for in a Code Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#things-to-look-for-in-a-code-review"></a></h4>
<p>Start by understanding what the code <em>should</em> do, by reading
the specification/user requirements, the pull request description or
talking to the developer if need be. In this case, understand what <a href="31-software-requirements.html">SR1.1.1</a> means.</p>
<p>Once you are happy, start reading the code (skip the test code for
now - we will come back to it later). you are going to be assessing the
code in the following key areas.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="is-the-proposed-code-readable">Is the proposed code readable?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#is-the-proposed-code-readable"></a></h5>

<li>Does the code implement something that is not the requirement or in
the issue/ticket?</li>
</ul></div>

<p>The overriding priority for reviewing code should be making sure
progress is being made - do not let perfect be the enemy of the good
here. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Kept-Secrets-Peer-Review/dp/1599160676" class="external-link">“Best
Kept Secrets of Peer Code Review” (Cohen, 2006)</a> the first hour of
reviewing code is the most effective, with diminishing returns after
that.</p>
<p>To that end, here are a few things you <em>should not</em> be trying
to spot when reviewing:</p>
<ul><li>Linting issues, or anything else that an automated tool can spot -
get the Continuous Integration (CI) to do it.</li>
<li>Bugs - instead make sure there are tests for all cases.</li>
<li>Issues that pre-date the change - raise separate PRs fixing these
issues separately to avoid heading down a rabbit hole.</li>
<li>Architecture re-writes - try to have design discussions upfront, or
else have a meeting to decide whether the code needs to be
rewritten.</li>
</ul></div>

<h4 id="adding-a-review-comment">Adding a review comment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-a-review-comment"></a></h4>
<p>Here, we are outlining the process of adding a review to a pull
request. There is doing to be an exercise next for you to practice
it.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Your fellow learner should add you as a collaborator on their
repository to begin with. They can do that from the
<code>Settings</code> tab of the repository, then
<code>Collaborators and teams</code> tab on the left, then clicking the
<code>Add people</code> button. Once they find you by your GitHub name -
you will receive an invitation via email to join the repository as a
collaborator. You will have to do the same for the collaborator doing
the review on your repository.</li>
</ol><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout</p>
<p>## Code Review from External Contributors</p>
<p>You do not have to be a collaborator on a public repository to do
code reviews so this step is not strictly necessary. We are still asking
you to do it now as we will get you working in teams for the rest of the
course so it may make sense to start setting up your collaborators
now.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/github-add-collaborator.png" class="image-with-shadow figure mx-auto d-block" alt="Adding a collaborator in GitHub" width="900"></figure><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p>Locate up the pull request from the GitHub’s
<code>Pull Requests</code> tab on the home page of your fellow learner’s
software repository, then head to the <code>Files changed</code> tab on
the pull request. <img src="fig/github-pull-request-files-changed.png" class="image-with-shadow figure" alt="The files changed tab of a pull request" width="900"></p></li>
<li><p>When you find a line that you want to add a comment to, click on
the blue plus (+) button next to the line. This will bring up a “Write”
box to add your comment. <img src="fig/github-pull-request-add-comment.png" class="image-with-shadow figure" alt="Adding a review comment to a pull request" width="800"> You can
also add comments referring to multiple lines by clicking the plus and
dragging down over the relevant lines. If you want to make a concrete
suggestion or a change to the code directly, such as renaming a
variable, you can click the <code>Add a suggestion</code> button (which
looks like a document with a plus and a minus in it). This will populate
the comment with the existing code, and you can edit it to be what you
think the code should be.</p></li>
</ol><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> you can only make direct code suggestions
if you are a collaborator on a repository. Otherwise, you can add
comments only.</em> <img src="fig/github-pull-request-add-suggestion.png" class="image-with-shadow figure" alt="Adding a suggestion to a pull request" width="800"> GitHub will then provide a button for the code author to
apply your changes directly.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p>Write your comment in the box, and then click
<code>Start review</code>. This will save your comment, but not publish
it yet. You can use <code>Add single comment</code> button to
immediately post a comment. However, it is best to batch the comments
into a single review, so that the author knows when you have finished
adding comments (and avoid spamming their email with
notifications).</p></li>

code is correct and well tested. One approach to do this is to build up
a list of tests you would expect to see (and the results you would
expect them to have), and then verify that all these tests are present
and correct.</p>
<p>Start by listing out all the tests you would expect to see based on
the specification. As you are going through the code, add to this list
any other tests you can think of, making sure to add tests for:</p>
<ul><li>All paths through the code.</li>
<li>Making each <code>if</code> statement be evaluated as
<code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.</li>
<li>Executing loops with empty, single and multi-element sequences.</li>
<li>Edge cases that you spot.</li>
<li>Any circumstances where you are not certain how code would
behave.</li>

to.</p>

arrays is currently spuriously passing as it does not use the return
value from the function in the assert.</p>
<p>You may have spotted that the function actually computes the variance
rather than the standard deviation. Perhaps that made you think to add
the test for some data where the variance and standard deviation are
different. In more complex examples, it is often easier to spot code
that looks like it could be wrong and think of a test that will exercise
it. This saves embarrassment if the code turns out to be right, means
you have the missing test written if it is wrong, and is often quicker
than trying to execute the code in your head to find out if it is
correct.</p>

have addressed it. Even better, leave a comment such as “Fixed via

recommendations</a> as to what a “large pull request” is but be aware
that it is not an exact science.</p>
<p>Try to keep each commit (within your pull request) to be making one
logical change. This can especially help with larger pull requests that
would otherwise be harder to review. In particular, if you have
reformatted, refactored and changed the behavior of the code make sure
each of these is in a separate commit (i.e reformat the code, commit,
refactor the code, commit, alter the behavior of the code, commit).</p>
<p>Make sure you write a clear description of the content and purpose of
the change. This should be provided as the pull request description.
This should provide the context needed to read the code.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to review your code yourself, before
requesting a review. In doing this you will spot the more obvious issues
with your code, allowing your reviewer to focus on the things you cannot
spot.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>Code is written by humans (mostly!), and code review is a form of
communication. As such, empathy is important for effective
reviewing.</p>
<p>When reviewing code, it can be sometimes frustrating when code is
confusing, particularly as it is implemented differently to how you
would have done it. However, it is important as a reviewer to be
compassionate to the person whose code you are reviewing.
Specifically:</p>
<ul><li>Identify positives in code as and when you find them (particularly
if it is an improvement on something you have fed back on in a previous
review).</li>
<li>Remember different does not mean better - only request changes if
the code is wrong or hard to understand.</li>
<li>Only provide a few non-critical suggestions - you are aiming for
better rather than perfect.</li>
<li>Ask questions to understand why something has been done a certain
way rather than assuming you know a better way.</li>
<li>If a conversation is taking place on a review and has not been
resolved by a single back-and-forth exchange, then schedule a
conversation to discuss instead (and record the outcome of the
discussion in the PR’s comments).</li>
</ul></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="defining-a-review-process-for-your-team">Defining a Review Process For Your Team<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#defining-a-review-process-for-your-team"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>To be effective, code review needs to be a process that is followed
by everyone in the team developing the code. Everyone should believe
that the process provides value. One way to foster this is to agree on
the review process as a team and consider, e.g.:</p>
<ul><li>Whether all changes need to go through code review</li>
<li>What technologies you are going to use to manage the review
process</li>
<li>How quickly you expect someone to review the code once a PR has been
raised</li>
<li>How long should be spent reviewing code</li>
<li>What kind of issues are (and are not) appropriate to raise in a
PR</li>
<li>How will someone know when they are expected to take action
(e.g. review a PR).</li>
</ul><p>You could also consider using pull request states in GitHub:</p>
<ul><li>Open a pull request in a <code>DRAFT</code> state to show progress
or request early feedback</li>
<li>
<code>READY FOR REVIEW</code> when you are ready for feedback</li>
<li>
<code>CHANGES REQUESTED</code> to let the author know they need to
fix the requested changes or discuss more</li>
<li>
<code>APPROVED</code> to let the author they can merge their pull
request.</li>
</ul><p>Once you have agreed on a review process, you should monitor (either
formally or informally) how well it is working.</p>
<p>It is important that reviews are processed quickly, to avoid costly
context switching for the code author moving on to work on other things
and coming back to their PR. Try and set the targets for when you would
want the first review submitted on a PR and the PR merged, based on how
your team works. If you are regularly missing your targets, then you
should review your process to identify where things are getting stuck
and work out what you can do to move things along.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Optional Exercise: Code Review in Your Own Working Environment</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In this episode we have looked at some best practices for code review
and practiced tool assisted code review with GitHub’s pull requests.</p>
<p>Now think about how you and your collaborators typically develop
code. What benefits do you see for introducing a code review process in
your work environment? How might you institute code review practices
within your environment? Write down a process for a tool assisted code
review for your team, answering the questions above.</p>
<p>Once complete, discuss with the rest of the class what are the
advantages of a code review process and what challenges you think you
would face in implementing this process in your own working
environment.</p>

<p>The purposes of code review include:</p>
<ul><li>improving internal code readability, understandability, quality and
maintainability,</li>
<li>checking for coding standards compliance, code uniformity and
consistency,</li>
<li>checking for test coverage and detecting bugs and code defects
early,</li>
<li>detecting performance problems and identifying code optimisation
points,</li>
<li>finding alternative/better solutions,</li>
<li>sharing knowledge of the code, and of coding standards and
expectations of quality.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, it helps increase the sense of collective code ownership and
responsibility, which in turn helps increase the “bus factor” and reduce
the risk resulting from information and capabilities being held by a
single person “responsible” for a certain part of the codebase and not
being shared among team members.</p>
<p>Challenges you might face introducing a code review process:</p>
<ul><li>complaints that it is a waste of time,</li>
<li>creating a negative atmosphere where people are overly critical of
each others work, or are defensive of their own,</li>
<li>perfectionism leading to slower development,</li>
<li>people not sharing code to avoid the review process.</li>
</ul><p>Make sure to monitor whether these are happening, and adjust the
process accordingly.</p>
