## Verifying Code Style Using Linters

Editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) can help us format our Python code in a consistent style. 
This aids reusability, since consistent-looking code is easier to modify since it's easier to read and understand.
We can also use tools, called [**code linters**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29), to identify consistency issues in a report-style.
Linters analyse source code to identify and report on stylistic and even programming errors. Let's look at a very well 
used one of these called `pylint`.

First, let's ensure we are on the `style-fixes` branch once again.

~~~
$ git checkout style-fixes
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Pylint is just a Python package so we can install it in our virtual environment using:

~~~
$ pip3 install pylint
$ pylint --version
~~~
{: .language-bash}

We should see the version of Pylint, something like:

~~~
pylint 2.13.3
...
~~~
{: .output}

Don't forget to update your virtual Python environment with this package, if you use one.

Pylint is a command-line tool that can help our code in many ways:

- **Check PEP8 compliance:** whilst in-IDE context-sensitive highlighting helps us stay consistent with PEP8 as we write code, this tool provides a full report
- **Perform basic error detection:** Pylint can look for certain Python type errors
- **Check variable naming conventions**: Pylint often goes beyond PEP8 to include other common conventions, such as naming variables outside of functions in upper case
- **Customisation**: you can specify which errors and conventions you wish to check for, and those you wish to ignore

Pylint can also identify **code smells**.

> ## How Does Code Smell?
>
> There are many ways that code can exhibit bad design whilst not breaking any rules and working correctly. A *code smell* is a characteristic that indicates that there is an underlying problem with source code, e.g. large classes or methods, methods with too many parameters, duplicated statements in both if and else blocks of conditionals, etc. They aren't functional errors in the code, but rather are certain structures that violate principles of good design and impact design quality. They can also indicate that code is in need of maintenance and refactoring.
>
> The phrase has its origins in Chapter 3 "Bad smells in code" by Kent Beck and Martin Fowler in [Fowler, Martin (1999). Refactoring. Improving the Design of Existing Code. Addison-Wesley. ISBN 0-201-48567-2](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/).

Pylint recommendations are given as warnings or errors, and Pylint also scores the code with an overall mark. 
We can look at a specific file (e.g. `inflammation-analysis.py`), or a module 
(e.g. `inflammation`). Let's look at our `inflammation` module and code inside it (namely `models.py` and `views.py`). 
From the project root do:

~~~
$ pylint inflammation
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You should see an output similar to the following:

~~~
************* Module inflammation.models
inflammation/models.py:5:82: C0303: Trailing whitespace (trailing-whitespace)
inflammation/models.py:6:66: C0303: Trailing whitespace (trailing-whitespace)
inflammation/models.py:34:0: C0305: Trailing newlines (trailing-newlines)
************* Module inflammation.views
inflammation/views.py:4:0: W0611: Unused numpy imported as np (unused-import)

------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 8.00/10 (previous run: 8.00/10, +0.00)
~~~
{: .output}

Your own outputs of the above commands may vary depending on how you have implemented and fixed the code in 
previous exercises and the coding style you have used. 

The five digit codes, such as `C0303`, are unique identifiers for warnings, with the first character indicating 
the type of warning. There are five different types of warnings that Pylint looks for, and you can get a summary of 
them by doing:

~~~
$ pylint --long-help
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Near the end you'll see:

~~~
  Output:
    Using the default text output, the message format is :
    MESSAGE_TYPE: LINE_NUM:[OBJECT:] MESSAGE
    There are 5 kind of message types :
    * (C) convention, for programming standard violation
    * (R) refactor, for bad code smell
    * (W) warning, for python specific problems
    * (E) error, for probable bugs in the code
    * (F) fatal, if an error occurred which prevented pylint from doing
    further processing.
~~~
{: .output}

So for an example of a Pylint Python-specific `warning`, see the "W0611: Unused numpy imported 
as np (unused-import)" warning.

It is important to note that while tools such as Pylint are great at giving you a starting point to consider how to 
improve your code, they won't find everything that may be wrong with it.

> ## How Does Pylint Calculate the Score?
>
> The Python formula used is (with the variables representing numbers of each type of infraction and `statement` indicating the total number of statements):
>
> ~~~
> 10.0 - ((float(5 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement) * 10)
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> For example, with a total of 31 statements of models.py and views.py, with a count of the errors shown above, we get 
> a score of 8.00. Note whilst there is a maximum score of 10, given the formula, there is no minimum score - it's quite possible to get a negative score!

> ## Exercise: Further Improve Code Style of Our Project
> Select and fix a few of the issues with our code that Pylint detected. Make sure you do not break the rest of the 
> code in the process and that the code still runs. After making any changes, run Pylint again to verify you've 
> resolved these issues.

Make sure you commit and push your list of packages and any file with further code style improvements you did and 
merge onto your development and main branches.
~~~
$ git add requirements.txt  # Depending on your virtual Python environment this file could have a different name
$ git commit -m "Added Pylint library"
$ git push origin style-fixes
$ git checkout develop
$ git merge style-fixes
$ git push origin develop
$ git checkout main
$ git merge develop
$ git push origin main
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Optional Exercise: Improve Code Style of Your Other Python Projects
> If you have a Python project you are working on or you worked on in the past, run it past Pylint to see what issues
> with your code are detected, if any.
{: .challenge}

It is possible to automate these kind of code checks with Bitbucket's Continuous Integration service Bitbucket Pipelines.
