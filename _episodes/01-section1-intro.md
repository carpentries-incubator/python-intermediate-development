- "Provide an overview of all the different tools that will be used in this course."
keypoints:
- "In order to develop (write, test, debug, backup) code efficiently,
you need to use a number of different tools."

to decide which tool is right for you, which may be a matter of personal preference or what the community you belong to is using."

The first section of the course is dedicated to setting up your environment for collaborative software development.
In order to build working (research) software
efficiently and to do it in collaboration with others rather than isolation, you will have to get comfortable
with using a number of different tools interchangeably as theyâ€™ll make your life a lot easier.
There are many options when it comes to deciding on which software development tools to use for your daily tasks - we
will use a few of them in this course that we believe make a difference. There are sometimes multiple tools for the
job - we select one to use but mention alternatives too. As you get more comfortable with different tools and
their alternatives, you will select the one that is right for you based on your personal preferences or
based on what your collaborators are using.

Here is an overview of the tools we will be using.

### Command Line & Virtual Development Environment
We will use the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))
(also known as the command line shell/prompt/console) to run our code and
interact with the version control tool Git and software sharing platform GitHub. We will also use command line
tools [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
to set up a virtual development environment and isolate our software project from other projects we may work on.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
An IDE integrates a number of tools that we need to develop a software project
that goes beyond a single script - including a smart code editor,
a code compiler/interpreter, a debugger, etc. It will help you write well-formatted & readable code that conforms to
code style guides (such as [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python) more efficiently by giving relevant and intelligent suggestions for
code completion and refactoring.
IDEs often integrates command line console and version control tools - we teach
them separately in this course as this knowledge can be ported to other programming languages and command line tools
you may use in the future (but is perfectly fine to use these integrated versions too).

We will use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) in this course - a free, open source IDE.

### Git & GitHub
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to save every change made to a
(software) project, allowing others to collaborate and contribute. In this course,
we use Git to version control our code in conjunction with [GitHub](https://github.com/) for code backup and sharing.
GitHub is one of the leading integrated products and
social platforms for modern software development, monitoring and management - it will help us with
version control, issue management, code review, code testing/Continuous Integration, and collaborative development.

Let's get started with setting up our software development environment!
