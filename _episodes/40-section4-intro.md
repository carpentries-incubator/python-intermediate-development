questions:
- "What practices help us develop software collaboratively that will make it easier for us and others to further develop and reuse it?"
objectives:
- "Understand the code review process and employ it to improve the quality of code."
keypoints:
- "Agreeing on a set of best practices within a software development team will help to improve your software's understandability, extensibility, testability, reusability and overall sustainability."

When changes - particularly big changes - are made to a codebase, how can we as a team ensure that these changes are well considered and represent good solutions?
And how can we increase the overall knowledge of a codebase across a team?
Sometimes project goals and time pressures take precedence and producing maintainable, reusable code is not given the
time it deserves. So, when a change or a new feature is needed - often the shortest route to making it work is taken
as opposed to a more well thought-out solution. For this reason, it is important not to write the code alone and in
isolation and use other team members verify each other's code and measure our coding standards against.
This process of having multiple team members comment on key code changes is called *code review* -
this is one of the most important practices of collaborative software development that helps ensure
the ‘good’ coding standards are achieved and maintained within a team, as well as increasing knowledge about the codebase across the team.
We'll thus look at the benefits of reviewing code,
in particular, the value of this type of activity within a team,
and how this can fit within various ways of team working.
We'll see how Bitbucket can support code review activities via pull requests,
and how we can do these ourselves making use of best practices.

Designing and Developing "Good" Software in Teams
- **Software paradigms and design architectures** for solving different problems based on clear requirements
- **Writing "good" software** that is understandable, modular, extensible and tested
- **Publishing and releasing software** for reuse by others
- **Collaborative code development and review** to improve software sustainability and avoid the accumulation of ‘technical debt’.
