# Alex the Astronomer

Alex is a postdoctoral researcher in astronomy, who finished their PhD 4 years ago. They had an undergraduate module on basic Python, self-learned the shell, and attended a Carpentries course on how to use Git.

As part of their research, Alex loads gigabytes of data files using common libraries like Pandas and SciPy, as well as field-specific libraries like Astropy. Their data is a mix of text and CSV files, and field-specific formats like FITS. The data is then fit with a range of simulation techniques. They work in Jupyter Notebooks but break some bits out into modules that they share them on GitHub, though they only have very minimal documentation.

Alex is collaborating with a large telescope facility, and will need to process even larger quantities of data, using more advanced techniques. They want to learn how to make their code more robust and rigorous, so that it can be integrated with the facility's data pipeline.

# Chris the Chemistry CDT Student

Chris is a new PhD student at a Centre for Doctoral Training for computational chemistry. Their undergraduate studies taught them basic Python, and they have taught themselves how to use VS Code.

Chris has now started a PhD in which they will be developing machine learning code to analyse chemical samples. They have no 'real world' experience, and have not seen or written any research code yet. As the CDT has a taught first year, they do not yet know precisely what the data and processes for their project will be.

Chris' CDT has arranged for their cohort to attend an Intermediate Software Carpentry as it would like to make sure that the code they produce is sustainable and high-quality. Chris' cohort is quite varied - some people have more domain experience, whilst others have computer science backgrounds.
