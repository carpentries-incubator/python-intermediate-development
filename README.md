## Intermediate Research Software Development Skills (Python)

This is an intermediate-level course in collaborative research software engineering and development skills,
using Python as an example language.
It teaches these skills in a way that mimics a typical software development
process working as a part of a team,
starting from an [existing piece of software](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-inflammation).

A typical learner for this course may be someone who has gained basic software development skills either by
self-learning or attending a foundational course such as the novice [Software Carpentry Python course][swc-lessons] and has been coding for 6-12 months.
However, their software
development-related projects are now becoming larger and more complex and they need more
intermediate software engineering skills to help them design more robust software code,
automate the process of testing and verifying its correctness and support collaborations with others.

> :warning: The course material can change at any point - if you are planning a workshop using this material,
> either let the maintainers know or make sure you use your own fork of the lesson.

The lesson uses [patient inflammation data](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/#scenario-a-miracle-arthritis-inflammation-cure) for code examples,
from the [Software Carpentry Python "inflammation" lesson][programming-with-python].

Check out the [variant of this lesson](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development-earth-sciences/tree/gh-pages)
that uses river catchment data in code examples (more suited for Earth and environmental scientists).

### Lesson Status

The course is in a stable beta - it has been run over 20 times times with
different cohorts by the lesson authors as well as independently by people not directly involved in the lesson development
and is in a good state to be reused and taught by others.

## Teaching the Lesson

The lesson is suitable for both instructor-led teaching or guided self-learning where helpers provide help
and answer questions (synchronously or asynchrounously) as learners go through the course on their own.
Initially, in sections 1-3 of the lesson,
learners are working on a software project and going though exercises individually.
In sections 4 and 5, they are grouped and work in teams,
as they would when collaborating on a team software project development.

The lesson has 5 sections;
each section can be delivered in one day by an instructor or worked through in self-learning mode over a half a day to a day,
depending on the pace.

If you would like to teach this lesson to your audience and help with more beta testing,
please let the lesson developers know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development/issues/new?assignees=&labels=pilot&template=lesson-pilot-issue-template.md&title=) with your workshop details and a
